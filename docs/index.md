# rpi-provisioner

> Have your raspberry pi ready to go using a couple commands.

It's a real pain when your Raspberry Pi dies due to sdcard corruption and you have to set it up again. Install your favourite shell, update all packagaes, set up the ssh connection, the static ip address...

That's why [rpi-provisioner](./) was created. There is a command for (almost) any tedios part of having your raspberry up and running again.

[rpi-provisioner](./) is created with the premise that someone can have the minimum hardware to operate it: a computer (may be portable), the raspberry and a cable to plug the raspberry. You don't need an extra screen, mouse or keyboard to use it.
